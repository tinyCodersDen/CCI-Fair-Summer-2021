# CCI-Fair-Summer-2021
Here is my project for the 2021 Summer CCI Fair. It is the Traffic follower AI robot, in here, I am using Opencv to detect the red signal and green signal. Then, I am detecting a stop sign using a haar cascade. I am using RPi.GPIO for the motors, and that's pretty much it, I hope you like my project.
